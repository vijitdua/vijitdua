## 🚀 About Me

Life's short - dream big, ship fast, be happy.

Who am I?
I'm Vijit Dua - engineer by day, music artist and youtuber by night.

I'm all about blending coding with my dream to kick off something cool on my own.
My philosophy? Collective contribution - make positive impacts wherever you go and enjoy life.

## 🛠️ Projects?

Most of my good projects are closed sourced, but you can use them / check them out on my [website](https://vijitdua.com/projects#live).
And you can check out my open source projects right here on GitHub!

## 💡 Interests

When I'm not buried in projects or busy being a student, I'm:
- 🏃‍♂️ Biking the trails, hitting the pavement on my runs, or frequenting the gym to stay fit.
- 👥 Meeting new people and diving into conversations—from casual banter to deep discussions over physics & philosophy.
- 🎥 Creating and editing videos for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@vijitdua).
- 🎶 Occasionally dabbling with music production.
- 🎮 Wielding lightsabers in BeatSaber, hopping onto population one, flying away in Rocket League, or exploring other (primarily VR, MacOS, or game-porting / Whisky - MacOS) games.
