## 🚀 About Me

I'm Vijit Dua, a builder, developer, & change catalyst. I'm all about blending coding with my dream to kick off something cool on my own. You can learn more about me [here](https://vijitdua.com/about).

Most of my good projects are closed sourced, but you can use them / check them out on my [website](https://vijitdua.com/projects#live).
And you can check out my open source projects right here on GitHub!

## 💡 Interests

When I'm not buried in projects or busy being a student, I'm:
- 🏃‍♂️ Biking the trails, hitting the pavement on my runs, or frequenting the gym to stay fit.
- 👥 Living for the thrill of meeting new people and diving into conversations—from casual banter to deep discussions over physics & philosopphy.
- 🎥 Creating and editing videos for my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@vijitdua).
- 🎶 Occasionally dabbling in music production with Ableton
- 🎮 (Rarely, but sometimes) Wielding lightsabers in BeatSaber, hopping onto population one, flying away in Rocket League, or exploring other (primarily VR, MacOS, or game-porting / Whisky - MacOS) games.

Feel free to fork or star my projects if you find them interesting. Happy coding! 🌟
